# Body Measurement AI Model

This repository contains the Python backend for a Body Measurement AI Model built using Gradio. The model takes in user inputs (such as height, and optionally weight and other parameters) to predict body measurements and recommend appropriate clothing sizes. The backend is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

> **Note:**  
> This project was created for the hackathon project **"HackX"** by RohanVashist, Saurabh Yadav, Sahil Shah, and Ayush Jha.

## Overview

The **Body Measurement AI Model** uses a combination of anthropometric formulas and/or trained machine learning models to estimate key body measurements (shoulder width, chest, waist, etc.) from user-provided data. The application features a user-friendly Gradio interface that:
- Accepts user input for body dimensions.
- Processes the input to generate predicted measurements.
- Returns recommended clothing sizes based on brand-specific size charts.

The backend is designed to be lightweight, easily deployable, and interactive via a web interface, and it is hosted on Hugging Face for quick access and demonstration.

---

## How It Works

1. **Input Collection:**  
   Users provide their body dimensions (e.g., height, and optionally weight or other parameters) via the Gradio interface.

2. **Measurement Prediction:**  
   The backend processes the input using a combination of pre-defined anthropometric ratios (or machine learning predictions) to estimate various body measurements.

3. **Size Recommendation:**  
   Based on the predicted measurements and integrated brand-specific size charts, the system recommends appropriate clothing sizes (e.g., S, M, L, XL).

4. **Interactive Interface:**  
   The Gradio interface enables users to visualize and interact with the predictions in real time. The simple and intuitive UI allows for immediate feedback.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HakashiKatake/Body-Measurment-AI-Model.git
   cd Body-Measurment-AI-Model
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Gradio App:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **View the App:**  
   Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860/`).
